# COVID19 Explorations

Various exploratory analyses on Scholarly Communications relating to the COVID-19 virus and pandemic.

## Keyword searches
We've found a few keywords relating to the COVID-19 outbreak. Research publishers can use these keywords in 2 ways:
1. Use them to find related articles published on your website. 
  - You can then make those articles free-to-read if they are not free already. 
  - You might also wish to make them into a special collection so that it is easy for people to find.
2. Find related articles in peer-review and then prioritise the peer-review of those articles. 
  - You might also consider recommending preprinting to authors of articles relating to the COVID-19 outbreak.

## Text modelling
This is aimed at using text data to explore literature relating to COVID-19 and other pandemics. 


### Note
I'm aiming to work quite quickly as I progress through these notebooks, so there won't always be proper testing, or documentation. Any problems, just ask and I'll try and make an update.
